**Visualization:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Angular 16] --> B(API Gateway)
    B --> C[.NET Core 8 APIs]
    C --> D{{Azure SQL MI}}
    C --> E(Kafka)
    style A fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**2.2 System Flow (Eligibility Check Example):**

1.  A member interacts with the **Member Portal (Angular 16)**.
2.  The portal sends an eligibility request to the **API Gateway**.
3.  The **API Gateway** routes the request to the **Eligibility Microservice (.NET Core 8 API)**.
4.  The **Eligibility Microservice** retrieves member data from **Azure SQL Managed Instance**.
5.  The eligibility status is determined and returned to the **API Gateway**, then back to the **Member Portal**.
6.  Optionally, an event might be published to **Kafka** for other interested services (e.g., logging or analytics).

**Visualization:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MP as Member Portal (Angular 16)
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant ES as Eligibility Service (.NET Core 8 API)
    participant DB as Azure SQL MI
    participant K as Kafka

    MP->>AG: Eligibility Request
    AG->>ES: Eligibility Request
    ES->>DB: Retrieve Member Data
    DB-->>ES: Member Data
    ES->>ES: Process Eligibility
    ES-->>AG: Eligibility Response
    AG-->>MP: Eligibility Response
    opt Asynchronous Event
        ES->>K: Publish Eligibility Event
    end
```

**3. Implementation Strategy**

Our implementation will follow an iterative approach, prioritizing the development and deployment of key microservices while ensuring infrastructure automation and robust security practices.

**3.1 Eligibility Microservice:**

The `EligibilityController.cs` snippet demonstrates a basic endpoint for creating eligibility records. In a real-world scenario, this would involve more complex business logic, data validation, and interaction with other services.

**Visualization (Simplified Class Diagram):**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class EligibilityController {
        [ApiController]
        [Authorize]
        [Route("api/v1/eligibility")]
        +CreateEligibility([FromBody] EligibilityRequest request) : Task<IActionResult>
        +GetEligibility(int id) : Task<ActionResult<Eligibility>>
    }
    class EligibilityRequest {
        +MemberId : string
        +PlanType : string
    }
    class Eligibility {
        +Id : int
        +MemberId : string
        +EffectiveDate : DateTime
        +PlanType : string
    }
    EligibilityController --|> ControllerBase
```

**3.2 Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):**

The `eligibility-deployment.yml` snippet showcases a Kubernetes deployment for the eligibility service. IaC using tools like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform will be crucial for managing and provisioning our Azure infrastructure consistently and repeatably.

**Visualization (Conceptual IaC Pipeline):**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Repository] --> B(IaC Templates)
    B --> C{ARM/Terraform}
    C -- Apply --> D[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]
    style A fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**3.3 Security Implementation:**

JWT validation, as shown in `Program.cs`, is a key aspect of securing our APIs. We will implement comprehensive security measures, including:

* **Authentication:** Using Azure Active Directory and OAuth 2.0 for secure user and service authentication.
* **Authorization:** Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate permissions.
* **Data Encryption:** Encrypting data at rest and in transit using Azure services and best practices.
* **Network Security:** Utilizing Azure Network Security Groups and other network controls to isolate and protect resources.

**Visualization (Simplified Security Layer Diagram):**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[External Clients] --> B(API Gateway)
    B -- OAuth 2.0 / JWT --> C[Backend Microservices]
    subgraph Azure AD
        D[Identity Provider]
    end
    B -- Authenticate --> D
    C -- Authorize --> D
    style D fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**4. Robust DevOps Pipeline**

An automated CI/CD pipeline is essential for efficient and reliable software delivery. Our pipeline will include:

* **Code Commit:** Triggers the pipeline upon code changes.
* **Build:** Compiles code, builds Docker images, and performs vulnerability scanning.
* **Test:** Executes automated unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.
* **Deploy:** Implements a blue/green deployment strategy to minimize downtime during updates to the AKS cluster.
* **Monitor:** Utilizes Azure Monitor for real-time logging, performance monitoring, and alerting.

**Visualization (CI/CD Pipeline Flow):**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Commit] --> B(Build & Test)
    B -- Successful --> C(Deploy to AKS (Blue/Green))
    C -- Successful --> D[Azure Monitor]
    B -- Failure --> E[Notifications & Alerts]
    C -- Failure --> E
    style A fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**5. Compliance and Rigorous Testing**

Adherence to HIPAA regulations is paramount. Our strategy includes:

* **HIPAA Audit Trail Implementation:** The `AuditLog` table demonstrates a basic audit logging mechanism. We will implement comprehensive audit logging to track data access and modifications, ensuring compliance with HIPAA requirements.
* **Security Protocols:** Implementing technical safeguards as mandated by HIPAA, including access controls, encryption, and integrity controls.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Continuous performance testing to ensure the platform meets the required service levels.
